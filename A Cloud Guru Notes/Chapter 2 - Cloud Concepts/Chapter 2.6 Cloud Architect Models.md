### Exam Tips
* Private cloud is Azure on your own hardware in a location of your choice. All the benefits of public cloud, but you can lock it down. A lot of staff required.
* Public cloud is Azure, AWS, GCP. No upfront costs, but monthly usage. Little control over services and infrastructure.
* A hybrid cloud model is the best of private and public, but could be complex.
